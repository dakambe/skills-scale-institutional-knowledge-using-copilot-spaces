## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme uses a customer-first, iterative, and data-informed project management approach, blending defined roles and measurable outcomes. Processes are refined from real team experience, continually improved, and documented for collective success.

**Key principles:**
- **Customer-first:** Deliver value and usability for end-users.
- **Iterative delivery:** Ship small, testable increments.
- **Clear ownership:** Projects have named PMs, Product Leads, and success criteria.
- **Communication:** Frequent syncs, status reports, and risk escalation.
- **Continuous improvement:** Regular retrospectives and action tracking.

**Lifecycle stages:**
1. **Initiation:** Clarify problem, define outcomes, align stakeholders ([Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)).
2. **Planning:** Break down work, estimate scope, identify risks and dependencies ([Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)).
3. **Execution:** Daily and weekly rhythms, task tracking, PR conventions, demos ([Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)).
4. **Release & Deployment:** Standardize pre-release, deployment, rollback, incident management ([Release & Deployment Guide](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)).
5. **Retrospective:** Capture learnings and drive continuous improvement ([Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)).

Roles such as Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, QA, and Stakeholder are defined for clarity and accountability ([Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)). Risks are tracked and escalated transparently ([Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)).
